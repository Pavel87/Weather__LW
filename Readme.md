Hello, 
First of all this was quite fun exercise. 

In fact I first wrote the app without Compose and then noticed few more steps in the requirements so had to rewrite part of it. 

#In regards to tech stack I used the following on top of the requirements:
- MVVM
- Koin for DI
- RxJava
- Repository pattern (though I am not doing any local caching)
- Retrofit
- Kotlin/Java
- Compose/Legacy XML

In regards to fluency you can probably see I can use Compose, but not feeling so happy about how I put it together I will 
have to spend a bit more time on my own to get more comfortable with it as we didn't get to it at my current job.
